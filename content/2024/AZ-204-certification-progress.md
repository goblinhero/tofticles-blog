At my employer, we have created a study group to prepare for the [AZ-204](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-204/) certification, centered around developing applications on the Azure platform. As may be expected from my previous rants around certifications and Microsoft in general, it will probably not surprise that I would like to have words.

First off, the entire exam is centered around whether you are able to work with Azure, not really about making applications. So, we are talking about deploying things, configuring things, trying to guess what Microsoft's engineers were thinking when they created their API's for Azure and so on. In my opinion - this is DevOps - and something you are (hopefully) automating the crap out of if you are doing this professionally.

Secondly, there are a -lot- of questions around licensing and pricing. Read: "Which most cost-effective license allows for having deployment slots?". This has -nothing- to do with developing, but trying to grasp the idiosyncrasies of Microsoft and licensing. Each part of Azure has it's own licensing options and there is no rhyme or reason across products. So, basically, you are left with trying to memorize whether 'Premium' for this product includes an isolated VPN network.

Thirdly, the practise exams on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com) has a very limited pool of questions, so if you take three practise exams, you'll have encountered all questions - and they do not (insert explicitive here) even closely resemble the actual exam. So, in essense, worthless.

There are several providers of materials to help you with preparing for the exams (including extremely boring videos) - [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/) and so on. Based on colleagues' opinions that passed the exam, I went with Whizlabs and a month worth of subscription. Judging by how poorly worded the questions are - they are probably pretty close to what I'll encounter in the exams. 

So, consider my next week a cram-session to get as much rote learning into my skull to be able to pass the exam.

There is something rotten in the industry - and certifications at present are a part of the problem.
