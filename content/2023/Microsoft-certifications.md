It's been a long time since I had to worry about certifications. Some twenty years ago, I took a few for a long since gone financial system. This was back when Microsoft had the MCSA, MCSD and MCSE certifications and those were a daunting thing to start on. They were deeply technical and you basically had to know the ins and outs of whichever platform you were aiming for. Apparently, those retired a few years back.

So, I went to Microsoft's [Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com) platform and poked around. It was an odd experience, like sort of surreal. I'm a .NET developer, so I would have imagined there'd be a host of C#, C#.core, ASP.Net etc. certifications. There are zero, as in -none-.

Instead, there are Azure certifications and my employer is willing to shell out for those, so I went and took three different Fundementals (the 900-series). To call them technical would be an overstatement. It's multiple choice - and if you've read the sales pitches and spent a few hours reading through the accompanying lessons, you are well on your way to passing.

A few workplaces back, we had a (derogatory) term for this: "Whiteboard consultants". The kind of consultants that could draw diagrams and list all the acronyms and buzzwords, but wouldn't be able to code their way out of a paperbag with a guide and a flash-light. It boggles my mind that there are no hardcore, hell, even novice certifications to prove that you know the difference between a for-loop and an if-statement.

So! I've asked around, and it seems the AZ-204 certification is at least somewhat harder, but it is still more handling the Azure platform than it is coding good software, but hey-ho. I will return with my findings.
