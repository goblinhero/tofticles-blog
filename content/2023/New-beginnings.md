It's been an eventful few months. My employer handed me a small'ish project that had me delving into real life practise with Azure, Terraform and Azure Functions. And now that I've walked the talk, done the work and cried a lot - I'm confident in saying that I'm not going to build anything for myself on Azure.

This is not a nag at my employer - they are simply delivering what businesses and the public sector are asking for. But it's simply too much crying for my hobbies. Wondering why things do not work as advertised, why things deprecate faster than I can say 'Wait, what?!' and why things then suddenly work without me having done anything different besides simply retrying. 

I've had to tell myself that there is a reason, I'm being paid for my work - they could not get anyone to do it for free.

Anyway, I'm going to shift focus on this blog and with my own project - and try something extremely stupid. I'm going to build a home-cluster, do something-something with Kubernetes with something-something Rancher... Compared to Azure - at least I won't rack up any kind of debt besides the electricity bill.
