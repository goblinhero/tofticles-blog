So, finally got back into blogging. And since I like control - this time around, I went with using a framework to create my blog with static pages. I know, I know - I could have just used a blogging platform somewhere.. and watched it be enshittified in a matter of months. I choose not to. 

Besides, this blog will also serve to document my adventures into Azure, since that is the platform of choice for my new employer - so, I need something to experiment on.

Hopefully, at some point this will be set up with pipelines and all that other fancy CI/CD that is all the rage.
