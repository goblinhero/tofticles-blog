This blog was primarily made to support my journey on becoming proficient with Azure. Things have changed, moving the focus more to an all-open-source self-hosted kind of deal. There'll be discussions about code as well, mostly me justifying my choices as I go along. 

You'll notice there is no comment section. This is a feature, not a bug. If you take issue with what I write - or just want to expand on something, please email me or contact me on Mastodon, the links are in the sidebar. The idea is that if your input is relevant, thought-provoking or otherwise interesting, I'll make a follow-up post explaining my thoughts on it. 

A wise man once said that if you spend more than 5 minutes answering a question in the comments, you are doing it wrong - put it on your blog instead. That way you do not have to repeat yourself in the next comment-section.

One last point, the RSS feed for this blog contains the full blog posts and the layout here is not meant to be the focus, so it is perfectly fine that you only read it in your favorite RSS-reader. There are no ads, no data being mined here - it is simply not the point. Use the material here any way you want. The code I present is under an MIT license, so go nuts, just don't come crying to me if it ends up the basis of your (failing) production system.
